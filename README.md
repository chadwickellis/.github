# Community Health Files

This repository centralises community health files for all my repositories, ensuring consistent standards for collaboration.

## Purpose

GitHub supports default community health files—such as issue templates, pull request templates, and contributing guidelines—that automatically apply to repositories lacking their own. This repository centralises and standardises these files for contributors.

## Files

This repository may include the following files, tailored to my projects' needs:

- **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md**: Defines expected behaviour and outlines how to report misconduct.
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Details guidelines for submitting issues and pull requests.
- **ISSUE_TEMPLATE/**: Provides templates for bug reports and feature suggestions.
- **LICENSE**: Specifies the terms under which the repository’s content can be used.
- **PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md**: Specifies the format and criteria for pull requests.
- **SECURITY.md**: Explains how to report security vulnerabilities.
- **SUPPORT.md**: Points users to resources for assistance.

## Usage

These files are inherited by all my repositories unless a repository defines its own, ensuring consistent contribution guidelines and templates.

1. Fork this repository.
2. Create a new branch.
